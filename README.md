# Activity Tracker Application FE MOD 2

A site for activity tracker users to see their activity data for the latest day, the latest week, and their data compared to the data of other users

## Background / About
Our Activity Tracker Application (aka Fit Lit) is a place for your everyday Fit Lit user to view the stats that they have accumulated. In a dashboard, somebody usually wants to see a colorful, yet informative display of information which is what we strived for. 

## Primary Learning Goals
 * Object Oriented Programming
  * jQuery
 * TDD with multiple classes and datasets
 * Complex Data Manipulation using prototype methods
 * GitHub Workflow
 
## Next Steps
  * A User should have their own aside with all sensitive information harder to access
  * Implementing Percentage based charts (Apple Watch Rings for example)
  * A more smooth, responsive layout
  * A highly accessible site for screen readers and with color schemes
  * Add user trends (i.e. You have surpassed your step goal for 3 days straight!!)
  * Compare user trends to user friends
